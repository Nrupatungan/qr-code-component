## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS animation
- Responisive Design
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
main {
  transition: width 0.5s ease;
  animation: introSlide 1s forwards;
}

@keyframes introLoad {
    0%{
        transform: translateY(-6.67rem);
        opacity: 0;
    }

    100%{
        transform: translateY(0);
        opacity: 1;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I'd love to improve in certain areas like animation, parallax images, grid layout, responsive design, semantic html and more.

## Acknowledgments

I worked with a friend of mine, who kept me motivated throughout the journey. We both did the same challenge and he gave me some important inputs on how to improve my output even further beyond. I guess, this is the best way to learn stuff when you're just starting. Although, I have fiddled with FrontEnd Development before to be frank, but I  had to drop it in the middle. Sike! Am I saying much?...
